    quote: `"It's just a phase they say of me," tweets @themoonforreal, winking. "But, it's true. Don't give up." In this original, thoughtful YA novel in verse, by Tucsonan Torran Anderson, a tweeting moon is the most consistent comfort for a despairing high school senior. Enzo's life-long friend J. has recently committed suicide, and he and buddies Matas and Sci-fi are driving around town, in time-honored Tucson fashion. Matas and Sci-fi are looking for parties; Enzo is looking to make sense of J.'s death. The action takes place in one night. From sunset on Gates Pass, through midtown, to Sabino Canyon in the east, and finally to early morning high in the northern Foothills, the boys cruise, party, hike, and kibitz. Enzo, however, feels apart. His mind and imagination manifest in individual strands: poems contemplate life and death; the moon tweets; a visceral yearning imagines a violent tribal rite of passage into adulthood; and a tempering, calming ongoing list of "tiny moments" argues to make life worthwhile. (Think "mom's mac and cheese"; the Rillito River with running water). It's not only young adults who can be touched by this affecting book.`,

    quote: `"You get drunk and it wears off, you fall in love and quickly climb out of it." Enzo Jones has lost a friend, maybe even more. He'll never know because that part of his life is gone now—forever—and the endless nights cruising with his buddies and looking for parties isn't enough to fill the hole that J's suicide has left. With no one but the moon to guide him through his grief, the desert night stretches on in an endless sea of lost souls and unsung potential. Why did she do it? Could he have made a difference? Some questions may never have answers, but life will go on without them. Using poetic verse and conjectural lists, as well as a voyeuristic—and sometimes cryptic—social media feed from the perspective of the moon, Piñata Moon deftly explores the complex issues of teen suicide and the effects it can have on the people it leaves behind. Seen through the lens of a Tucson teenager, Anderson's narrative considers the value of life and its potential, as well as the questions left unanswered after the sudden, jarring absence of a loved one. Partly an ode to the desert landscape, the striking imagery and poetic language serves as a warm background for a cold subject, creating a juxtaposition that fuels the piecemeal story toward a daring conclusion that pushes the reader into existential reflection. Edgy, inventive, and sincere, Anderson gives the reader a new look at an old medium, creating a unique experience that keeps hold of the reader long after the last page has been turned.`,
